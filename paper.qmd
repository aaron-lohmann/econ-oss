  Open source software (OSS) is powering much of our digital infrastructure. From hosting websites, to working with databases and advancement of Machine Learning models. Recently, OSS has received increased attention from the economic discipline. Some work is motivated by the curious incentive structures, the econmic value created through OSS or the available and detailed micro-data. The goal for this project is to openly and publically craft a literature review which summarises our findings about OSS, especially relating to economics. Inspired by OSS itself, this project is open to contribution from anyone. Reward in the form of co-authorship is given according to contribution.
